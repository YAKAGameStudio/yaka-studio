## Me

I'm a Microsoft employee, working on **Technology Strategy** for a large Enterprise account.  
You can easily assume / understand that I will not covert non-Microsoft Technologies. 
I will focus on how you can leverage [Azure Game Stack](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games) components for your Game.

Even if I've some knowledge on infrastructure and development due to my 20 years spent in consulting, I will assume that I don't know anything.  
So, for each post, I'll provide guidance and/or links related to training. This is sometimes a great habit to do a full knowledge refresh. Specially when facing the cloud technologies. 

If you are a senior Developer, please be soft. You may already know everything I am describing there.

## Game Development with Azure Game Stack

For training purpose, I've start a crypto company [YAKA Games](https://yaka.games/) (my own Contoso), to experiment knowledge gain during training.  
The purpose is to create a full environment, as an Indee Game Studio that release Mobile Game based on [Azure Game Stack](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games) should do.

I've spend much time than expected to find the right or up-to-date information about how to do it.  
That's why, within this repository, you can find tips and tricks I've gain.

I hope that you will find what you are looking for.
